# react-memory-game

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app), and inspired by Marina Ferria's [Vanilla JavaScript Memory Game](https://marina-ferreira.github.io/projects/js/memory-game/).

A simple React memory card game to help me practice React, Git, Markdown, and CSS, among other things.

## Lore

After finishing the official React Tic-Tac-Toe tutorial I wanted to practice what I learned. I saw Marina Ferria's Vanilla JavaScript Memory Game a while ago on freeCodeCamp and decided I would try my hand at re-creating it in React. For this project I wanted to test myself as much as possible, so I restricted myself to only the React Docs, my React Tic-Tac-Toe game, and Marina's game. I was only allowed to Google for CSS problems, because this project wouldn't get done otherwise.

## How it Works

Download the .zip here or `git clone`
Run `npm start` in the repo to start the server
Enjoy the game :)

TODO: Explain how to get repo and run, explain game simply, include pictures and/or gifs

## TODO

- Make it not look terrible lol
- Responsive / mobile-friendly / resizeability
- Maximum browser compatibility and support
- Improve animation
- Comment more and better
- Refactor and improve redundant / inefficient code

### Special Thanks

Shoutout to my brother Randy for:
- Simplifying my algorithm to dynamically get the alt text
- Listening to me complain about CSS a lot
